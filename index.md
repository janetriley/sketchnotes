###Chad Fowler - [Disposable Components](https://youtu.be/4LMWsFbj6js)
2014 Garden City Ruby keynote

Imagine if software behaved like biological systems that adapt to stay in balance. Individual components may be destroyed, but the organism's functionality survives.  Fowler describes how they've emulated that at Wunderkinder.

Some day I'd like to work on a project with the sophisticated continuous deployment, monitoring, and componentization he describes.  It sounds scary and exhiliarating, like building your own [honey badger](https://youtu.be/4r7wHMg5Yjg).  Bad deploy? Honey badger's gonna pass out for a few minutes, then gets right back up. Honey badger don't care.


###Ned Batchelder -[Practical Unicode](bit.ly/unipain)  
Pycon 2012

Unicode is here. Five unavoidable facts and three tips to deal with it.   Batchelder's explanations are always straightforward and clear.  Sketchnotes: [1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janetriley/sketchnotes/master/batchelder-practical-unicode-1.jpg) [2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janetriley/sketchnotes/master/batchelder-practical-unicode-2.jpg) [3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janetriley/sketchnotes/master/batchelder-practical-unicode-3.jpg)

I had a little run-in with encoding detection that led me to this talk. Facts 4 and 5 - so true. 


###Beth Dunn - [Use Your Words](http://www.bethdunn.com/use-your-words) 
Inbound 2015  
Sage advice from Grandma: "Choose your words and use your words so they present the image you want to present." Ten  specific changes to improve our writing.  Sketchnotes: [1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janetriley/sketchnotes/master/dunn-use-your-words-1.jpg) [2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janetriley/sketchnotes/master/dunn-use-your-words-2.jpg)


I found Dunn's talks through [Present! A Techie's Guide to Public Speaking](http://femgineer.com/present-book/). Her speaking style is relaxed and engaging.  The slides for Use Your Words were classical paintings, something I've never seen before. Both talks show good presentation technique as well as useful content, worth studying.
